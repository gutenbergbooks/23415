    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eustace Greyne (pronounced Green) wrinkled her forehead&mdash;that
      noble, that startling forehead which had been written about in the
      newspapers of two hemispheres&mdash;laid down her American Squeezer pen,
      and sighed. It was an autumn day, nipping and melancholy, full of the
      rustle of dying leaves and the faint sound of muffin bells, and Belgrave
      Square looked sad even to the great female novelist who had written her
      way into a mansion there. Fog hung about with the policeman on the
      pavement. The passing motor cars were like shadows. Their stertorous
      pantings sounded to Mrs. Greyne&rsquo;s ears like the asthma of dying monsters.
      She sighed again, and murmured in a deep contralto voice: &ldquo;It must be so.&rdquo;
       Then she got up, crossed the heavy Persian carpet which had been bought
      with the proceeds of a short story in her earlier days, and placed her
      forefinger upon an electric bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like lightning a powdered giant came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Greyne gone out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his study, ma&rsquo;am, pasting the last of the cuttings into the new
      album.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne smiled. It was a pretty picture the unconscious six-footer had
      conjured up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to disturb Mr. Greyne,&rdquo; she answered, with that gracious, and
      even curling suavity which won all hearts; &ldquo;but I wish to see him. Will
      you ask him to come to me for a moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The giant flew, silk-stockinged, to obey the mandate, while Mrs. Greyne
      sat down on a carved oaken chair of ecclesiastical aspect to await her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a famous woman, a personage, this simply-attired lady. With an
      American Squeezer pen she had won fame, fortune, and a mansion in Belgrave
      Square, and all without the sacrifice of principle. Respectability
      incarnate, she had so dealt with the sorrows and evils of the world that
      she had rendered them utterly acceptable to Mrs. Grundy, Mr. Grundy, and
      all the Misses Grundy. People said she dived into the depths of human
      nature, and brought up nothing that need scandalise a curate&rsquo;s
      grandmother, or the whole-aunt of an archdeacon; and this was so true that
      she had made a really prodigious amount of money. Her large, her solid,
      her unrelenting books lay upon every table. Even the smart set kept them,
      uncut&mdash;like pretty sinners who have never been &ldquo;found out&rdquo;&mdash;to
      give an air of haphazard intellectuality to frisky boudoirs, All the
      clergy, however unable to get their tithes, bought them. All bishops
      alluded to them in &ldquo;pulpit utterances.&rdquo; Fabulous prices were paid for them
      by magazine editors. They ran as serials through all the tale of months.
      The suburbs battened on them. The provinces adored them. Country people
      talked of no other literature. In fact, Mrs. Eustace Greyne was a really
      fabulous success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, then, should she heave these heavy sighs in Belgrave Square? Why
      should she lift an intellectual hand as though to tousle the glossy
      chestnut bandeaux which swept back from her forcible forehead, and screw
      her reassuring features into these wrinkles of perplexity and distress?
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and Mr. Eustace Greyne appeared, &ldquo;What is it, Eugenia?&rdquo;
       upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne was a number of years younger than his celebrated wife, and
      looked even younger than his years. He was a very smart man, with smooth,
      jet-black hair, which he wore parted in the middle; pleasant, dark eyes
      that could twinkle gently; a clear, pale complexion; and a nice, tall
      figure. One felt, in glancing at him, that he had been an Eton boy, and
      had at least thought of going into the militia at some period of his life.
      His history can be briefly told.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he emerged into the world before he met and was married to
      Mrs. Eustace Greyne, then Miss Eugenia Hannibal-Barker. He had had no time
      to sow a single oat, wild or otherwise; no time to adore a barmaid, or
      wish to have his name linked with that of an actress; no time to do
      anything wrong, or even to know, with the complete accuracy desired by all
      persevering young men, what was really wrong. Miss Eugenia Hannibal-Barker
      sailed upon his horizon, and he struck his flag to matrimony. Ever since
      then he had been her husband, and had never, even for one second, emerged
      beyond the boundaries of the most intellectual respectability. He was the
      most innocent of men, although he knew all the important editors in
      London. Swaddled in money by his successful wife, he considered her a
      goddess. She poured the thousands into Coutts&rsquo; Bank, and with the arrival
      of each fresh thousand he was more firmly convinced that she was a
      goddess. To say he looked up to her would be too mild. As the Cockney
      tourist in Chamounix peers at the summit of Mont Blanc, he peered at Mrs.
      Greyne. And when, finally, she bought the lease of the mansion in Belgrave
      Square, he knew her Delphic.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now he appeared in the oracle&rsquo;s retreat respectfully, &ldquo;What is it,
      Eugenia?&rdquo; upon his admiring lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, my husband,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne subsided by the fire, placing his pointed patent-leather toes
      upon the burnished fender. Without the fog grew deeper, and the chorus of
      the muffin bells more plaintive. The fire-light, flickering over Mrs.
      Greyne&rsquo;s majestic features, made them look Rembrandtesque. Her large,
      oxlike eyes were fixed and thoughtful. After a pause, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eustace, I shall have to send you upon a mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mission, Eugenia!&rdquo; said Mr. Greyne in great surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mission of the utmost importance, the utmost delicacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it anything to do with Romeike &amp; Curtice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it take me far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my trouble. It will take you very far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of&mdash;not out of England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it will take you to Algeria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; cried Mr. Greyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; Mr. Greyne repeated after a short interval. &ldquo;Am I to go
      alone?&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course you must take Darrell.&rdquo; Darrell was Mr. Greyne&rsquo;s valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what am I to do at Algiers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must obtain for me there the whole of the material for book six of
      &lsquo;Catherine&rsquo;s Repentance,&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Catherine&rsquo;s Repentance&rdquo; was the gigantic novel
      upon which Mrs. Greyne was at that moment engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not disguise from you, Eustace,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Greyne, looking
      increasingly Rembrandtesque, &ldquo;that, in my present work, I am taking a
      somewhat new departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but we are very comfortable here,&rdquo; said Mr. Greyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      With each new book they had changed their abode. &ldquo;Harriet&rdquo; took them from
      Phillimore Gardens to Queensgate Terrace; &ldquo;Jane&rsquo;s Desire&rdquo; moved them on to
      a corner house in Sloane Street; with &ldquo;Isobel&rsquo;s Fortune&rdquo; they passed to
      Curzon Street; &ldquo;Susan&rsquo;s Vanity&rdquo; landed them in Coburg Place; and, finally,
      &ldquo;Margaret&rsquo;s Involution&rdquo; had planted them in Belgrave Square. Now, with
      each of these works of genius Mrs. Greyne had taken what she called &ldquo;a new
      departure.&rdquo; Mr. Greyne&rsquo;s remark is, therefore, explicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. Still, there is always Park Lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She mused for a moment. Then, leaning more heavily upon the carved lions
      of her chair, she continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hitherto, although I have sometimes dealt with human frailty, I have
      treated it gently. I have never betrayed a Zola-spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zola! My darling!&rdquo; cried Mr. Eustace Greyne. &ldquo;You are surely not going to
      betray anything of that sort now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she does we shall soon have to move off to West Kensington,&rdquo; was his
      secret thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But in book six of &lsquo;Catherine&rsquo; I have to deal with sin, with tumult,
      with African frailty. It is inevitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed once more. The burden of the new book was very heavy upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;African frailty!&rdquo; murmured the astonished Eustace Greyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, neither you nor I, my husband, know anything about this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, my darling. How should we? We have never explored beyond
      Lucerne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must, therefore, get to know about it&mdash;at least you must. For I
      cannot leave London. The continuity of the brain&rsquo;s travelling must not be
      imperiled by any violent bodily activity. In the present stage of my book
      a sea journey might be disastrous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly you should keep quiet, my love. But then&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go for me to Algiers. There you must get me what I want. I fear
      you will have to poke about in the native quarters a good deal for it, so
      you had better buy two revolvers, one for yourself and one for Darrell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne gasped. The calmness of his wife amazed him. He was not
      intellectual enough to comprehend fully the deep imaginings of a mighty
      brain, the obsession work is in the worker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;African frailty is what I want,&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Greyne. &ldquo;One hundred
      closely-printed pages of African frailty. You will collect for me the raw
      material, and I shall so manipulate it that it will fall discreetly, even
      elevatingly, into the artistic whole. Do you understand me, Eustace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to travel to Algiers, and see all the wickedness to be seen there,
      take notes of it, and bring them back to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how long am I to stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until you have made yourself acquainted with the depths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fortnight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think that would be enough. Take Brush&rsquo;s remedy for seasickness
      and plenty of antipyrin, your fur coat for the crossing, and a white
      helmet and umbrella for the arrival. You have lead pencils?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A couple of Merrin&rsquo;s exercise-books should be enough to contain your
      notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When am I to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner the better. I am at a standstill for want of the material. You
      might catch the express to Paris to-morrow; no, say the day after
      to-morrow.&rdquo; She looked at him tenderly. &ldquo;The parting will be bitter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very bitter,&rdquo; Mr. Eustace Greyne replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt really upset. Mrs. Greyne laid the hand which had brought them
      from Phillimore Gardens to Belgrave Square gently upon his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of the result,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The greatest book I have done yet. A
      book that will last. A book that will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take us to Park Lane,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rembrandtesque head nodded. The noble features, as of a strictly
      respectable Roman emperor, relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A book that will take us to Park Lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door opened, and the footman inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could Mademoiselle Verbena see you for a minute, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Verbena was the French governess of the two little Greynes.
      The great novelist had consented to become a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another moment Mademoiselle Verbena was added to the group beside the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0002" id="link2H_4_0002">

    <div style="height: 4em;">
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      We have said that Mademoiselle Verbena was the French governess of little
      Adolphus and Olivia Greyne, and so she was to this extent&mdash;that she
      taught them French, and that Mr. and Mrs. Greyne supposed her to be a
      Parisian. But life has its little ironies. Mademoiselle Verbena in the
      house of this great and respectable novelist was one of them; for she was
      a Levantine, born at Port Said of a Suez Canal father and a Suez Canal
      mother. Now, nobody can desire to say anything against Port Said. At the
      same time, few mothers would inevitably pick it out as the ideal spot from
      which a beneficent influence for childhood&rsquo;s happy hour would be certain
      to emanate. Nor, it must be allowed, is a Suez Canal ancestry specially
      necessary to a trainer of young souls. It may not be a drawback, but it
      can hardly be described as an advantage. This, Mademoiselle Verbena was
      intelligent enough to know. She, therefore, concealed the fact that her
      father had been a dredger of Monsieur de Lesseps&rsquo; triumph, her mother a
      bar-lady of the historic coal wharf where the ships are fed, and preferred
      to suppose&mdash;and to permit others to suppose&mdash;that she had first
      seen the light in the Rue St. Honoré, her parents being a count and
      countess of some old régime.
    </p>
    <p>
      This supposition, retained from her earliest years, had affected her
      appearance and her manner. She was a very neat, very trim, even a very
      attractive little person, with dark brown, roguish eyes, blue-black hair,
      a fairy-like figure, and the prettiest hands and feet imaginable. She had
      first attracted Mrs. Greyne&rsquo;s attention by her devotion to St. Paul&rsquo;s
      Cathedral, and this devotion she still kept up. Whenever she had an hour
      or two free she always&mdash;so she herself said&mdash;spent it in &ldquo;<i>ce
      charmant</i> St. Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she entered the oracle&rsquo;s retreat she cast down her eyes, and trembled
      visibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Miss Verbena?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Greyne, with a kindly English
      accent, calculated to set any poor French creature quite at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Verbena trembled more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have received bad news, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grieve to hear it. Of what nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma has <i>une bronchite très grave</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A what, Miss Verbena?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, madame. A very grave bronchitis. She cries for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctors say she will die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Levantine wept. Even Suez Canal folk are not proof against all human
      sympathy. Mr. Greyne blew his nose beside the fire, and Mrs. Greyne said
      again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat that this is very sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, if I do not go to mamma tomorrow I shall not see her more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne looked very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she remarked. She thought profoundly for a moment, and then added:
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Mademoiselle Verbena flung herself down on the Persian carpet at
      Mrs. Greyne&rsquo;s large but well-proportioned feet, and, bathing them with her
      tears, cried in a heartrending manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame will let me go! madame will permit me to fly to poor mamma&mdash;to
      close her dying eyes&mdash;to kiss once again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne was visibly affected, and even Mrs. Greyne seemed somewhat put
      about, for she moved her feet rather hastily out of reach of the
      dependant&rsquo;s emotion, and made her scramble up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your poor mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Paris, madame. In the Rue St. Honoré, where I was born. Oh, if she
      should die there! If she should&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne raised her hand, commanding silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to go there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If madame permits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow? This is decidedly abrupt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mais la bronchite, madame</i>, she is abrupt, and death, she may be
      abrupt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. One moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant&rsquo;s silence for Mrs. Greyne to let loose her brain in.
      She did so, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have my permission. Go to-morrow, but return as soon as possible. I
      do not wish Adolphus to lose his still uncertain grasp upon the irregular
      verbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a flood of grateful tears Mademoiselle Verbena retired to make her
      preparations. On the morrow she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morrow was a day of much perplexity, much bustle and excitement for
      Mr. Greyne and the valet, Darrell. They were preparing for Algiers. In the
      morning, at an early hour, Mr. Greyne set forth in the barouche with Mrs.
      Greyne to purchase African necessaries: a small but well-supplied medicine
      chest, a pith helmet, a white-and-green umbrella, a Baedeker, a couple of
      Smith &amp; Wesson Springfield revolvers with a due amount of cartridges,
      a dozen of Merrin&rsquo;s exercise-books&mdash;on mature reflection Mrs. Creyne
      thought that two would hardly contain a sufficient amount of African
      frailty for her present purpose&mdash;a packet of lead pencils, some
      bottles of a remedy for seasickness, a silver flask for cognac, and
      various other trifles such as travellers in distant continents require.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Darrell was learning French for the journey, and packing his own
      and his master&rsquo;s trunks. The worthy fellow, a man of twenty-five summers,
      had never been across the Channel&mdash;the Greynes being by no means
      prone to foreign travel&mdash;and it may, therefore, be imagined that he
      was in a state of considerable expectation as he laid the trousers, coats,
      and waistcoats in their respective places, selected such boots as seemed
      likely to wear well in a tropical climate, and dropped those shirts which
      are so contrived as to admit plenty of ventilation to the heated body into
      the case reserved for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Greyne returned from his shopping excursion the barouche, loaded
      almost to the gunwale&mdash;if one may be permitted a nautical expression
      in this connection&mdash;had to be disburdened, and its contents conveyed
      upstairs to Mr. Greyne&rsquo;s bedroom, into which Mrs. Greyne herself presently
      entered to give directions for their disposing. Nor was it till the hour
      of sunset that everything was in due order, the straps set fast, the keys
      duly turned in the locks&mdash;the labels&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Eustace Greyne:
      Passenger to Algiers: via Marseilles&rdquo;&mdash;carefully written out in a
      full, round hand. Rook&rsquo;s tickets had been bought; so now everything was
      ready, and the last evening in England might be spent by Mr. Greyne in the
      drawing-room and by Darrell in the servants&rsquo; hall quietly, socially,
      perhaps pathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pathos of the situation, it must be confessed, appealed more to the
      master than to the servant. Darrell was very gay, and inclined to be
      boastful, full of information as to how he would comport himself with
      &ldquo;them there Frenchies,&rdquo; and how he would make &ldquo;them pore, godless Arabs
      sit up.&rdquo; But Mr. Greyne&rsquo;s attitude of mind was very different. As the
      night drew on, and Mrs. Greyne and he sat by the wood fire in the
      magnificent drawing-room, to which they always adjourned after dinner, a
      keen sense of the sorrow of departure swept over them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lonely you will feel without me, Eugenia,&rdquo; said Mr. Greyne. &ldquo;I have
      been thinking of that all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Eustace, how desolate will be your tale of days! My mind runs
      much on that. You will miss me at every hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so accustomed to have me within call, to depend upon me for
      encouragement in your life-work. I scarcely know how you will get on when
      I am far across the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, for whom I have labored, for whom I have planned and calculated,
      what will be your sensations when you realize that a gulf&mdash;the Gulf
      of Lyons&mdash;is fixed irrevocably between us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So their thoughts ran. Each one was full of tender pity for the other.
      Towards bedtime, however, conscious that the time for colloquy was running
      short, they fell into more practical discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Mr. Greyne, &ldquo;whether I shall find any difficulty in
      gaining the information you require, my darling. I suppose these places&rdquo;&mdash;he
      spoke vaguely, for his thoughts were vague&mdash;&ldquo;are somewhat awkward to
      come at. Naturally they would avoid the eye of day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne looked profound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Evil ever seeks the darkness. You will have to do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think my investigations must take place at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should certainly suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where shall I find a cicerone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apply to Rook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what terms? You see, dearest, this is rather a special matter, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very special. But on no account hint that you are in Algiers for
      &lsquo;Catherine&rsquo;s&rsquo; sake. It would get into the papers. It would be cabled to
      America. The whole reading world would be agog, and the future interest of
      the book discounted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne looked at his wife with reverence. In such moments he realized,
      almost too poignantly, her great position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be careful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What would you recommend me to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Greyne knit her superb forehead&mdash;&ldquo;I should suggest
      that you present yourself as an ordinary traveler, but with a specially
      inquiring bent of mind and a slight tendency towards the&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;hidden
      things of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you wish me to visit the public houses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you to see everything that has part or lot in African frailty. Go
      everywhere, see everything. Bring your notes to me, and I will select such
      fragments of the broken commandments as suit my purpose, which is, as
      always, the edifying of the human race. Only this time I mean to purge it
      as by fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That corner house in Park Lane, next to the Duke of Ebury&rsquo;s, would suit
      us very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Greyne reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could sell our lease here at an advance,&rdquo; his wife rejoined. &ldquo;You will
      not waste your journey, Eustace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love,&rdquo; returned Mr. Greyne with decision, &ldquo;I will apply to Rook on
      arrival, and, if I find his man unsatisfactory, if I have any reason to
      suspect that I am not being shown everything&mdash;more especially in the
      Kasbah region, which, from the guide-books we bought to-day, is, I take
      it, the most abandoned portion of the city&mdash;I will seek another
      cicerone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so. And now to bed. You must sleep well to-night in preparation for
      the journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was their invariable habit before retiring to drink each a tumbler of
      barley water, which was set out by the butler in Mrs. Greyne&rsquo;s study.
      After this nightcap Mrs. Greyne wrote up her anticipatory diary, while Mr.
      Greyne smoked a mild cigar, and then they went to bed. To-night, as usual,
      they repaired to the sanctum, and drank their barley water. Having done
      so, Mr. Greyne drew forth his cigar-case, while Mrs. Greyne went to her
      writing-table, and prepared to unlock the drawer in which her diary
      reposed, safe from all prying eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The match was struck, the key was inserted in the lock, and turned. As the
      cigar end glowed the drawer was opened. Mr. Greyne heard a contralto cry.
      He turned from the arm-chair in which he was just about to seat himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love, is anything the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife was bending forward with both hands in the drawer, telling over
      its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My diary is not here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your diary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;he came over to her&mdash;&ldquo;this is very serious. I presume,
      like all diaries, it is full of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Instinctively he had been
      about to say &ldquo;damning&rdquo;; he remembered his dear one&rsquo;s irreproachable
      character and substituted &ldquo;precious secrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is full of matter which must never be given to the world&mdash;my
      secret thoughts, my aspirations. The whole history of my soul is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! It must be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They searched the writing-table. They searched the room. No diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you have taken it to my room, and left it there?&rdquo; asked Mr. Greyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hastened thither, and looked&mdash;in vain. By this time the servants
      were gone to bed, and the two searchers were quite alone on the ground
      floor of their magnificent mansion. Mrs. Greyne began to look seriously
      perturbed. Her Roman features worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is appalling,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Some thief, knowing it priceless,
      must have stolen the diary. It will be published in America. It will bring
      in thousands&mdash;but to others, not to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to wring her hands. It was near midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think, my love, think!&rdquo; cried Mr. Greyne. &ldquo;Where could you have taken it?
      You had it last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I remember writing in it that you would be sailing to Algiers
      on the <i>Général Bertrand</i> on Thursday of this week, and that on the
      night I should be feeling widowed here. The previous night I wrote that
      yesterday I should have to tell you of your mission. You know I always put
      down beforehand what I shall do, what I shall even think on each
      succeeding day. It is a practice that regulates the mind and conduct, that
      helps to uniformity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How true! Who can have taken it? Do you ever leave it about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. Am I a madwoman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, compose yourself! We must search the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They proceeded to do so, and, on coming into the schoolroom, Mrs. Greyne,
      who was in front, uttered a sudden cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the table of Mademoiselle Verbena lay the diary, open at the
      following entry:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      On Thursday next poor Eustace will be on board the <i>Général Bertrand</i>,
      sailing for Algiers. I shall be here thinking of myself, and of him in
      relation to myself. God help us both. Duty is sometimes stern. Mem. The
      corner house in Park Lane, next the Duke of Ebury&rsquo;s, has sixty years still
      to run; the lease, that is. Thursday&mdash;poor Eustace!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this portend?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Greyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, it passes my wit to imagine,&rdquo; replied her husband.
    </p>

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The parting of Mr. and Mrs. Greyne on the following morning was very
      affecting. It took place at Victoria Station, in the midst of a small
      crowd of admiring strangers, who had recognised the commanding presence of
      the great novelist, and had gathered round to observe her manifestations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne was considerably shaken by the event of the previous night.
      Although, on the discovery of the diary, the house had been roused, and
      all the servants closely questioned, no light had been thrown upon its
      migration from the locked drawer to the schoolroom table. Adolphus and
      Olivia, jerked from sleep by the hasty hands of a maid, could only weep
      and wan. The powdered footmen, one and all, declared they had never heard
      of a diary. The butler gave warning on the spot, keeping on his nightcap
      to give greater effect to his pronunciamento. It was all most
      unsatisfactory, and for one wild moment Mrs. Greyne seriously thought of
      retaining her husband by her as a protection against the mysterious thief
      who had been at work in their midst. Could it be Mademoiselle Verbena? The
      dread surmise occurred, but Mr. Greyne rejected it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father was a count,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Besides, my darling, I don&rsquo;t believe
      she can read English; certainly not unless it is printed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So there the matter rested, and the moment of parting came.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur of respectful sympathy as Mrs. Greyne clasped her
      husband tenderly in her arms, and pressed his head against her
      prune-coloured bonnet strings. The whistle sounded. The train moved on.
      Leaning from a reserved first-class compartment, Mr. Greyne waved a silk
      pocket-handkerchief so long as his wife&rsquo;s Roman profile stood out clear
      against the fog and smoke of London. But at last it faded, grew remote,
      took on the appearance of a feebly-executed crayon drawing, vanished. He
      sank back upon the cushions&mdash;alone. Darrell was travelling second
      with the dressing-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange sensation, to be alone, and <i>en route</i> to Algiers.
      Mr. Greyne scarcely knew what to make of it. A schoolboy suddenly
      despatched to Timbuctoo could hardly have felt more terribly emancipated
      than he did. He was so absolutely unaccustomed to freedom, he had been for
      so long without the faintest desire for it, that to have it thrust upon
      him so suddenly was almost alarming. He felt lonely, anxious, horribly
      unmarried. To divert his thoughts he drew forth a Merrin&rsquo;s exercise-book
      and a pencil, and wrote on the first page, in large letters, &ldquo;<i>African
      Frailty, Notes for</i>&rdquo; Then he sat gazing at the title of his first
      literary work, and wondering what on earth he was going to see in Algiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vague visions of himself in the bars of African public-houses, in mosques,
      in the two-pair-backs of dervishes, in bazaars&mdash;which he pictured to
      himself like those opened by royalties at the Queen&rsquo;s Hall&mdash;in
      Moorish interiors surrounded by voluptuous ladies with large oval eyes,
      black tresses, and Turkish trousers of spangled muslin, flitted before his
      mental gaze. When the train ran upon Dover Pier, and the white horses of
      the turbulent Channel foamed at his feet, he started as one roused from a
      Rip Van Winkle sleep. Severe illness occupied his whole attention for a
      time, and then recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Paris he dined at the buffet like one in a dream, and, at the appointed
      hour, came forth to take the <i>rapide</i> for Marseilles. He looked for
      Darrell and the dressing-case. They were not to be seen. There stood the
      train. Passengers were mounting into it. Old ladies with agitated faces
      were buying pillows and nibbling biscuits. Elderly gentlemen with yellow
      countenances and red ribands in their coats were purchasing the <i>Figaro</i>
      and the <i>Gil Blas</i>. Children with bare legs were being hauled into
      compartments. Rook&rsquo;s agent was explaining to a muddled tourist in a
      tam-o&rsquo;-shanter the exact difference between the words &ldquo;Oui&rdquo; and &ldquo;Non&rdquo; The
      bustle of departure was in the air, but Darrell was not to be seen. Mr.
      Greyne had left him upon the platform with minute directions as to the
      point from which the train would start and the hour of its going. Yet he
      had vanished. The most frantic search, the most frenzied inquiries of
      officials and total strangers, failed to elicit his whereabouts, and,
      finally, Mr. Greyne was flung forcibly upward into the <i>wagonlit</i>,
      and caught by the <i>contrôleur</i> when the train was actually moving out
      of the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he fell exhausted upon the pink-plush seat of his
      compartment, realising his terrible position. He was now utterly alone;
      without servant, hair-brushes, toothbrushes, razors, sponges, pajamas,
      shoes. It was a solitude that might be felt. He thought of the sea journey
      with no kindly hand to minister to him, the arrival in Africa with no
      humble companion at his side, to wonder with him at the black inhabitants
      and help him through the customs&mdash;to say nothing of the manners. He
      thought of the dread homes of iniquity into which he must penetrate by
      night in search of the material for the voracious &ldquo;Catherine.&rdquo; He had
      meant to take Darrell with him to them all&mdash;Darrell, whose joyful
      delight in the prospect of exploring the Eastern fastnesses of crime had
      been so boyish, so truly English in its frank, its even boisterous
      sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he was utterly alone, almost like Robinson Crusoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>contrôleur</i> came in to make the bed. Mr. Greyne told him the
      dreadful story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt he has been lured away, monsieur. The dressing-case was of
      value?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crocodile, gold fittings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably monsieur will never see him again. As likely as not he will
      sleep in the Seine to-night, and at the morgue to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne shuddered. This was an ill omen for his expedition. He drank a
      stiff whisky-and-soda instead of the usual barley water, and went to bed
      to dream of bloody murders in which he was the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the train ran into Marseilles next morning he was an unshaven,
      miserable man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I time to buy a tooth-brush,&rdquo; he inquired anxiously at the station,
      &ldquo;before the boat sails for Algiers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>chef de gare</i> thought so. Monsieur had four hours, if that was
      sufficient. Mr. Greyne hastened forth, had a Turkish bath, purchased a new
      dressing-case, ate a hasty <i>déjeuner</i>, and took a cab to the wharf.
      It was a long drive over the stony streets. He glanced from side to side,
      watching the bustling traffic, the hurry of the nations going to and from
      the ships. His eyes rested upon two Arabs who were striding along in his
      direction. Doubtless they were also bound for Algiers. He thought they
      looked most wicked, and hastily took a note of them for &ldquo;African Frailty.&rdquo;
       Beside his sense of loss and loneliness marched the sense of duty. The
      great woman at home in Belgrave Square, founder of his fortunes, mother of
      his children, she depended upon him. Even in his own hour of need he would
      not fail her. He took a lead pencil, and wrote down:
    </p>
    <p>
      Saw two Arab ruffians. Bare legs. Look capable of anything. Should not be
      surprised to hear that they had&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      There he paused. That they had what? Done things. Of course, but what
      things? That was the question. He exerted his imagination, but failed to
      arrive at any conclusion as to their probable crimes. His knowledge of
      wickedness was really absurdly limited. For the first time he felt
      slightly ashamed of it, and began to wish he had gone into the militia. He
      comforted himself with the thought that in a fortnight he would probably
      be fit for the regular army. This thought cheered him slightly, and it was
      with a slight smile upon his face that he welcomed the first glimpse of
      the <i>Général Bertrand</i>, which was lying against the quay ready to
      cast off at the stroke of noon. Most of the passengers were aboard, but,
      as Mr. Greyne stepped out of his cab, and prepared to pay the Maltese
      driver, a trim little lady, plainly dressed in black, and carrying a tiny
      and rather coquettish hand-bag, was tripping lightly across the gangway.
      Mr. Greyne glanced at her as he turned to follow, glanced, and then
      started. That back was surely familiar to him. Where could he have seen it
      before? He searched his memory as the little lady vanished. It was a
      smart, even a <i>chic</i> back, a back that knew how to take care of
      itself, a back that need not go through the world alone, a back, in fine,
      that was most distinctly attractive, if not absolutely alluring. Where had
      he seen it before, or had he ever seen it at all? He thought of his wife&rsquo;s
      back, flat, powerful, uncompromising. This was very different, more&mdash;how
      should he put it to himself?&mdash;more Algerian, perhaps. He could
      vaguely conceive it a back such as one might meet with while engaged in
      adding to one&rsquo;s stock of knowledge of&mdash;well&mdash;African frailty.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the steward appeared to show him to his cabin, and his
      further reflections were mainly connected with the Gulf of Lyons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight was beginning to fall when, so far as he was capable of thinking,
      he thought he would like a breath of air. For some moments he lay quite
      still, dwelling on this idea which had so mysteriously come to him. Then
      he got up, and thought again, seated upon the cabin floor. He knew there
      was a deck. He remembered having seen one when he came aboard. He put on
      his fur coat, still sitting on the cabin floor. The process took some time&mdash;he
      fancied about a couple of years. At last, however, it was completed, and
      he rose to his feet with the assistance of the washstand and the berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship seemed very busy, full of almost American activity. He thought a
      greater calm would have been more decent, and waited in the hope that the
      floor would presently cease to forget itself. As it showed no symptoms of
      complying with his desire he endeavoured to spurn it, and, in the fulness
      of time, gained the companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very strange, as he remembered afterwards, that only when he had
      gained the companion did the sense of his utter loneliness rush upon him
      with overwhelming force: one of the ironies of life, he supposed.
      Eventually he shook the companion off with a good deal of difficulty, and
      found himself installed upon planks under a grey sky, and holding fast to
      a railing, which was all that interposed between him and eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he was only conscious of greyness and the noise of winds and
      waters, but presently a black daub seemed to hover for a second somewhere
      on the verge of his world, to hover and disappear. He wondered what it
      was. A smut, perhaps. He rubbed his face. The daub returned. It was very
      large for a smut. He strove to locate it, and found that it must be
      somewhere on his left cheek. With a great effort he took out his
      pocket-handkerchief. Suddenly the daub assumed monstrous proportions. He
      turned his head, and perceived the lady in black whom he had seen tripping
      over the gangway on his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a few steps from him, leaning upon the rail in an attitude of the
      deepest dejection, with her face averted; yet it struck him that her right
      shoulder was oddly familiar, as her back had surely been. The turn of her
      head, too&mdash;he coughed despairingly. The lady took no notice. He
      coughed again. Interest was quickening in him. He was determined to see
      the lady&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time she looked around, showing a pale countenance bedewed with
      tears, and totally devoid of any expression which he could connect with a
      consciousness of his presence. For a moment she stared vacantly at him,
      while he, with almost equal vacancy, regarded her. Then a thrill of
      surprise shook him. A sudden light of knowledge leaped up in him, and he
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Verbena!&rdquo; &ldquo;Monsieur?&rdquo; murmured the lady, with an accent of
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Verbena! Surely it is&mdash;it must be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had staggered sideways, nearing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Verbena, do you not know me? It is I, Eustace Greyne, the
      father of your pupils, the husband of Mrs. Eustace Greyne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An expression of stark amazement came into the lady&rsquo;s face at these words.
      She leaned forward till her eyes were close to Mr. Greyne&rsquo;s then gave a
      little cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> It is true! You are so altered that I could not
      recognise. And then&mdash;what are you doing here, on the wide sea, far
      from madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just about to ask you the very same question!&rdquo; cried Mr. Greyne.
    </p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, monsieur!&rdquo; said Mademoiselle Verbena in her silvery voice, &ldquo;I go to
      see my poor mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I understood that she was dying in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so. But, when I reached the Rue St. Honoré, I found that they had
      removed to Algiers. It was the only chance, the doctor said&mdash;a warm
      climate, the sun of Africa. There was no time to let me know. They took
      her away at once. And now I follow&mdash;perhaps to find her dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Large tears rolled down her cheeks. Mr. Greyne was deeply affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope for the best,&rdquo; he exclaimed, seized by a happy inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Levantine strove to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, monsieur, why are you here? Ah! perhaps madame is with you! Let
      me go to her! Let me kiss her dear hands once more&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne mournfully checked her fond excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite alone,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tragic expression came into the Levantine&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible for him to tell her about &ldquo;Catherine.&rdquo; He was,
      therefore, constrained to subterfuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I was suddenly overtaken by&mdash;by influenza,&rdquo; he said, in some
      confusion. &ldquo;The doctor recommended change of air, of scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He suggested Algiers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> It is like poor mamma!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. Our constitutions are&mdash;are doubtless similar. I shall
      take this opportunity also of improving my knowledge of African manners
      and&mdash;and customs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strange smile seemed to dawn for a second on Mademoiselle Verbena&rsquo;s
      face, but it died instantaneously in a grimace of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My teeth make me bad,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ah, monsieur, I must go below, to pray
      for poor mamma&mdash;&rdquo; she paused, then softly added, &ldquo;and for monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a movement as if to depart, but Mr. Greyne begged her to remain.
      In his loneliness the sight even of a Levantine whom he knew solaced his
      yearning heart. He felt quite friendly towards this poor, unhappy girl,
      for whom, perhaps, such a shock was preparing upon the distant shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better stay!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The air will do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if I die, what matter? Unless mamma lives there is no one in the
      world who cares for me, for whom I care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;there is Mrs. Greyne,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;And then St. Paul&rsquo;s&mdash;remember
      St. Paul&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah <i>ce charmant</i> St. Paul&rsquo;s! Shall I ever see him more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at Mr. Greyne, and suddenly&mdash;he knew not why&mdash;Mr.
      Greyne remembered the incident of the diary, and blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur has fever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne shook his head. The Levantine eyed him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur wishes to say something to me, and does not like to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne made an effort. Now that he was with this gentle lady, with her
      white face, her weeping eyes, her plain black dress, the mere suspicion
      that she could have opened a locked drawer with a secret key, and filched
      therefrom a private record, seemed to him unpardonable. Yet, for a brief
      instant, it had occurred to him, and Mrs. Greyne had seriously held it. He
      looked at Mademoiselle Verbena, and a sudden impulse to tell her the truth
      overcame him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In broken words&mdash;the ship was still very busy&mdash;Mr. Greyne
      related the incident of the loss and finding of the diary. As he spoke a
      slight change stole over the Levantine&rsquo;s face. It certainly became less
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have fever now!&rdquo; cried Mr. Greyne anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! No; I flush with horror, not with fever! The diary, the sacred diary
      of madame, exposed to view, read by the children, perhaps the servants!
      That footman, Thomas, with the nose of curiosity! Ah! I behold that nose
      penetrating into the holy secrets of the existence of madame! I behold it&mdash;ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She burst into a fit of hysterics, the laughing species, which is so much
      more terrible than the other sort. Mr. Greyne was greatly concerned. He
      lurched to her, and implored her to be calm; but she only laughed the
      more, while tears streamed down her cheeks. The vision of Thomas gloating
      over Mrs. Greyne&rsquo;s diary seemed utterly to unnerve her, and Mr. Greyne was
      able to measure, by this ebullition of horror, the depth of the respect
      and affection entertained by her for his beloved wife. When, at length,
      she grew calmer he escorted her towards her cabin, offering her his arm,
      on which she leaned heavily. As soon as they were in the narrow and
      heaving passage she turned to him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can have taken the diary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne blushed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We think it was Thomas,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Verbena looked at him steadily for a moment, then she cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne was startled by the abruptness of this pious ejaculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a good man. You, at least, would not condescend to insult a
      friendless woman by unworthy suspicions. And madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Greyne&rdquo;&mdash;stammered Mr. Greyne&mdash;&ldquo;is convinced that it was
      Thomas. In fact&mdash;in fact, she was the first to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Verbena tenderly pressed his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame is an angel. God bless you both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tottered into her cabin, and, as she shut the door, Mr. Greyne heard
      the terrible, laughing hysterics beginning again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day an influence from Africa seemed spread upon the sea. Calm
      were the waters, calm and blue. No cloud appeared in the sky. The fierce
      activities of the ship had ceased, and Mademoiselle Verbena tripped upon
      the deck at an early hour, to find Mr. Greyne already installed there, and
      looking positively cheerful. He started up as he perceived her, and
      chivalrously escorted her to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone who has made a voyage knows that the sea breeds intimacies. By
      the time the white houses of Algiers rose on their hill out of the bosom
      of the waves Mademoiselle Verbena and Mr. Greyne were&mdash;shall we say
      like sister and brother? She had told him all about her childhood in dear
      Paris, the death of her father the count, murmuring the name of Louis
      XVI., the poverty of her mother the countess, her own resolve to put aside
      all aristocratic prejudices and earn her own living. He, in return, had
      related his Eton days, his momentary bias towards the militia, his
      marriage&mdash;as an innocent youth&mdash;with Miss Eugenia
      Hannibal-Barker. Coming to later times, he was led to confide to the
      tenderhearted Levantine the fact that he hoped to increase his stock of
      knowledge while in Africa. Without alluding to &ldquo;Catherine,&rdquo; he hinted that
      the cure of influenza was not his only reason for foreign travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to learn something of men and&mdash;and women,&rdquo; he murmured in the
      shell-like ear presented to him. &ldquo;Of their passions, their desires, their&mdash;their
      follies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Mademoiselle Verbena. &ldquo;Would that I could assist monsieur! But
      I am only an ignorant little creature, and know nothing of the world! And
      I shall be ever at the bedside of mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will give me your address? You will let me inquire for the countess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly; but I do not know where I shall be. There will be a message at
      the wharf. To what hotel goes monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Grand Hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will write there when I have seen mamma. And meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were coming into harbour. The heights of Mustapha were visible, the
      woods of the Bois de Boulogne, the towers of the Hotel Splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile, may I beg monsieur not to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to what?&rdquo; asked Mr. Greyne most softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to let anyone in England know that I am here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused. Mr. Greyne was silent, wondering. Mademoiselle Verbena drooped
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world is so censorious. It might seem strange that I&mdash;that
      monsieur&mdash;a man young, handsome, fascinating&mdash;the same ship&mdash;I
      have no chaperon&mdash;enfin&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could get out no more. Her delicacy, her forethought touched Mr.
      Greyne to tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are right. The world is evil, and, as you say,
      I am a&mdash;not a word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ventured to press her hand, as an elder brother might have pressed it.
      For the first time he realised that even to the husband of Mrs. Eustace
      Greyne the world might attribute&mdash;Goodness gracious! What might not
      the militia think, for instance?
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself, for one moment, potentially a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted in a whirl of Arabs on the quay. Mr. Greyne would have stayed
      to assist Mademoiselle Verbena, but she bade him go.
    </p>
    <p>
      She whispered that she thought it &ldquo;better&rdquo; that they should not seem to&mdash;<i>enfin!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will write to-morrow,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;<i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the last word she was gone. Mr. Greyne saw nothing but Arabs and hotel
      porters. Loneliness seemed to close in on him once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      That very evening, after a cup of tea, he presented himself at the office
      of Rook near the Place du Gouvernement. As he came in he felt a little
      nervous. There were no tourists in the office, and a courteous clerk with
      a bright and searching eye at once took him in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we do for you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a stranger here,&rdquo; began Mr. Greyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, sir, quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk twiddled his business-like thumbs, and looked inquiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And being so,&rdquo; Mr. Greyne went on, &ldquo;it is naturally my wish to see as
      much of the town as possible; as much as possible, you understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want a guide? Alphonso!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning, he shouted to an inner room, from which in a moment emerged a
      short, stout, swarthy personage with a Jewish nose, a French head, an Arab
      eye with a squint in it, and a markedly Maltese expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an excellent guide, sir,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;He speaks twenty-five
      languages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stout man, who&mdash;as Mr Greyne now perceived&mdash;had on a Swiss
      suit of clothes, a panama hat, and a pair of German elastic-sided boots,
      confessed in pigeon English, interspersed occasionally with a word or two
      of something which Mr. Greyne took to be Chinese, that such was
      undoubtedly the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish to see? The mosque, the bazaars, St. Eugène, La Trappe,
      Mustapha, the baths of the Etat-Major, the Jardin d&rsquo;Essai, the
      Villa-Anti-Juif, the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment!&rdquo; said Mr. Greyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I take a chair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be seated, sir, pray be seated, and confer with Alphonso.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he gave himself to an enormous ledger, while Mr. Greyne took a
      chair opposite to Alphonso, who stood in a Moorish attitude looking
      apparently in the direction of Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come here,&rdquo; said Mr. Greyne, lowering his voice, &ldquo;with a
      purpose.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to see the Belle Fatma. I will arrange it. She receives every
      evening in her house in the Rue &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute! One minute! You said the something &lsquo;Fatma&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Belle Fatma, the most beautiful woman of Africa. She receives every&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me! One moment! Is this lady&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; said Alphonso, settling his Spanish neck-tie, and gazing steadily
      towards Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this lady&mdash;well, sinful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alphonso threw up his hands with a wild Asiatic gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sinful! La Belle Fatma! She is a lady of the utmost respectability known
      to all the town. You go to her house at eight, you take coffee upon the
      red sofas, you talk with La Belle, you see the dances and hear the music.
      Do not fear, sir; it is good, it is respectable as England, your country&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is respectable I don&rsquo;t want to see it,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Greyne. &ldquo;It
      would be a waste of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk lifted his head from the ledger, and Alphonso, by means of
      standing with his back almost square to Mr. Greyne, and looking over his
      right shoulder, succeeded at length in fixing his eye upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not travelled here to see respectable things,&rdquo; continued Mr.
      Greyne, with a slight blush. &ldquo;Quite the contrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Alphonso seemed to have changed, to have taken on a hard,
      almost a menacing tone. Mr. Greyne thought of his beloved wife, of
      Merrin&rsquo;s exercise-books, and clenched his hands, endeavouring to feel, and
      to go on, like a militiaman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite the contrary,&rdquo; he repeated firmly; &ldquo;my object in coming to Africa
      is to&mdash;to search about in the Kasbah, and the disrep&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He choked, recovered himself, and continued: &ldquo;Disreputable quarters of
      Algiers&mdash;hem&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Alphonso was certainly changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; said Mr. Greyne, growing purple. &ldquo;For frailty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For frailty&mdash;for wickedness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight cackle emanated from the ledger, but immediately died away. A
      dead silence reigned in the office, broken only by the distant sound of
      the sea, and by the hard breathing of Alphonso, who had suddenly begun to
      pant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to go to all the wicked places&mdash;<i>all!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ledger cackled again more audibly. Mr. Greyne felt a prickling
      sensation run over him, but the thought of &ldquo;Catherine&rdquo; nerved him to his
      awful task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my wife&rsquo;s express desire that I should do so,&rdquo; he added
      desperately, quite forgetting Mrs. Greyne&rsquo;s injunction to keep her dark in
      his desire to stand well with Rook&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ledger went off into a hyena imitation, and Alphonso, turning still
      more away from Mr. Greyne, so as to get the eye fuller upon him,
      exclaimed, in a mixture of Aryan and Eurasian languages:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I am a respectable, unmarried man. I was born in Buenos Ayres,
      educated in Smyrna, came of age in Constantinople, and have practised as
      guide in Bagdad and other particular cities. I refuse to have anything to
      do with you and your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he bounced into the inner room, and banged the door, while the
      ledger gave itself up to peals of merriment, and Mr. Greyne tottered forth
      upon the sea-front, bathed in a cold perspiration, and feeling more guilty
      than a murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a staggering blow. He leaned over the stone parapet of the low
      wall, and let the soft breezes from the bay flit through his hair, and
      thought of Mrs. Greyne spurned by Alphonso. What was he to do? Kicked out
      of Rook&rsquo;s, to whom could he apply? There must be wickedness in Algiers,
      but where? He saw none, though night was falling and stout Frenchmen were
      already intent upon their absinthe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does monsieur wish to see the Kasbah to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it a voice from heaven? He turned, and saw standing beside him a tall,
      thin, audacious-looking young man, with coal-black moustaches, magnificent
      eyes, and an air that was half-languid, half-serpentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a guide, monsieur. Here are my certificates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He produced from the inner pocket of his coat a large bundle of dirty
      papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If monsieur will deign to look them over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Greyne waved them away. What did he care for Certificates? Here
      was a guide to African frailty. That was sufficient. He was in a desperate
      mood, and uttered desperate words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said rapidly, &ldquo;are you wicked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very wicked, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wicked, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that it is good for me that you are wicked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I wish to be&mdash;that is, to see the other thing. Can you
      undertake to show me everything shocking in Algiers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But certainly, monsieur. For a consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name your price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred pounds, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne started. It seemed a high figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur thought it would be more? I make a special price, because I have
      taken a fancy to monsieur. I remove fifty pounds. Monsieur, of course,
      will pay all expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was no time to draw back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long will it take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see all the shocking&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a good deal. A fortnight, three weeks. It depends on monsieur.
      If he is strong, and can do without sleep&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have to be up at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go to bed during the day, and get through it in a fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be at the Grand Hotel to-night at ten o&rsquo;clock precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At ten o&rsquo;clock I will be there. Monsieur will pay a little in advance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are twenty pounds,&rdquo; cried Mr. Greyne recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audacious-looking young man took the notes with decision, made a
      graceful salute, and disappeared in the direction of the quay, while Mr.
      Greyne walked to his hotel, flushed with excitement, and feeling like the
      most desperate criminal in Africa. If the militia could see him now!
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner he drank a bottle of champagne, and afterwards smoked a strong
      cigar over his coffee and liqueur. As he was finishing these frantic
      enjoyments the head waiter&mdash;a personage bearing a strong resemblance
      to an enlarged edition of Napoleon the First&mdash;approached him rather
      furtively, and, bending down, whispered in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman has called to take monsieur to the Kasbah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne started, and flushed a guilty red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come in a moment,&rdquo; he answered, trying to assume a nonchalant
      voice, such as that in which a hardened major of dragoons announces that
      in his time he was a devil of a fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head waiter retired, looking painfully intelligent, and Mr. Greyne
      sprang upstairs, seized a Merrin&rsquo;s exercise-book and a lead pencil, put on
      a dark overcoat, popped one of the Springfield revolvers into the pocket
      of it, and hastened down into the hall of the hotel, where the
      audacious-looking young man was standing, surrounded by saucy chasseurs in
      gay liveries and peaked caps, by Algerian waiters, and by German-Swiss
      porters, all of whom were smiling and looking choke-full of sympathetic
      comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Mr. Greyne, still in the major&rsquo;s, voice. &ldquo;There you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold me, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wicked, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s be off to the mosque.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the chasseurs&mdash;a child of eight who was thankful that he knew
      no better&mdash;burst into a piping laugh. The waiters turned hastily
      away, and the German-Swiss porters retreated to the bureau with some
      activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the mosque&mdash;precisely, monsieur,&rdquo; returned the guide, with
      complete self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stepped out at once upon the pavement, where a carriage was in
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Greyne in an anxious voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to the heights to see the Ouled,&rdquo; replied the guide. &ldquo;<i>En
      avant!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bounded in beside Mr. Greyne, the coachman cracked his whip, the horses
      trotted. They were off upon their terrible pilgrimage.
    </p>
    <p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      On the following afternoon, at a quarter to three, when Mr. Greyne came
      down to breakfast, he found, lying beside the boiled eggs, a note directed
      to him in a feminine handwriting. He tote it open with trembling fingers,
      and read as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 Rue du Petit Neore.

     Dear Monsieur,&mdash;I am here. Poor mamma is in the hospital. I
     am allowed to see her twice a day. At all other times I
     remain alone, praying and weeping. I trust that monsieur has
     passed a good night. For me, I was sleepless, thinking of
     mamma.    I go now to church.

     Adele Verbena.
</pre>
    <p>
      He laid this missive down, and sighed deeply. How strangely innocent it
      was, how simple, how sincere! There were white souls in Algiers&mdash;yes,
      even in Algiers. Strange that he should know one! Strange that he, who had
      filled a Merrin&rsquo;s exercise-book with tiny writing, and had even overflowed
      on to the cover after &ldquo;crossing&rdquo; many pages, should receive the child-like
      confidences of one! &ldquo;I go now to the church.&rdquo; Tears came into his eyes as
      he laid the letter down beside a pile of buttered toast over which the
      burning afternoon sun of Africa was shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur will take milk and sugar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the head waiter&rsquo;s Napoleonic voice. Mr. Greyne controlled himself.
      The man was smiling intelligently. All the staff of the hotel smiled
      intelligently at Mr. Greyne to-day&mdash;the waiters, the porters, the
      chasseurs. The child of eight who was thankful that he knew no better had
      greeted him with a merry laugh as he came down to breakfast, and an &ldquo;<i>Oh,
      là, là!</i>&rdquo; which had elicited a rebuke from the proprietor. Indeed, a
      wave of human sympathy flowed upon Mr. Greyne, whose ashy face and dull,
      washed-out eyes betrayed the severity of his night-watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur will feel better after a little food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The head waiter handed the buttered toast with bland majesty, at the same
      time shooting a reproving glance at the little chasseur, who was peeping
      from behind the door at the afternoon breakfaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel perfectly well,&rdquo; replied Mr. Greyne, with an attempt at
      cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, monsieur will feel much better after a little food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne began to toy with an egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Algiers?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was born here, monsieur. If monsieur wishes to explore to-night again
      the Kasbah I can&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Greyne stopped him with a gesture that was almost fierce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the Rue du Petit Nègre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur wishes to go there to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to go there now, directly I have finished break&mdash;lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The head waiter&rsquo;s face was wreathed with humorous surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But monsieur is wonderful&mdash;superb! Never have I seen a traveller
      like monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at Mr. Greyne with tropical appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur had better have a carriage. The street is difficult to find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order me one. I shall start at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne pushed away the sunlit buttered toast, and got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is superb. Never have I seen a traveller like monsieur!&rdquo;
       Napoleon&rsquo;s voice was almost reverent. He hastened out, followed slowly by
      Mr. Greyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A carriage for monsieur! Monsieur desires to go to the Rue du Petit
      Nègre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The staff of the hotel gathered about the door as if to speed a royal
      personage, and Mr. Greyne noticed that their faces too were touched with
      an almost startled reverence. He stepped into the carriage, signed feebly,
      but with determination, to the Arab coachman, and was driven away,
      followed by a parting &ldquo;<i>Oh, là là!</i>&rdquo; from the chasseur, uttered in a
      voice that sounded shrill with sheer amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through winding, crowded streets he went, by bazaars and Moorish
      bath-houses, mosques and Catholic churches, barracks and cafés, till at
      length the carriage turned into an alley that crept up a steep hill. It
      moved on a little way, and then stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur must descend here,&rdquo; said the coachman. &ldquo;Mount the steps, go to
      the right and then to the left. Near the summit of the hill he will find
      the Rue du Petit Nègre. Shall I wait for monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coachman began to make a cigarette, while Mr. Greyne set forth to
      follow his directions, and, at length, stood before an arch, which opened
      into a courtyard adorned with orange-trees in tubs, and paved with blue
      and white tiles. Around this courtyard was a three-storey house with a
      flat roof, and from a bureau near a little fountain a stout Frenchwoman
      called to demand his business. He asked for Mademoiselle Verbena, and was
      at once shown into a saloon lined with chairs covered with yellow rep, and
      begged to take a seat. In two minutes Mademoiselle Verbena appeared,
      drying her eyes with a tiny pocket-handkerchief, and forcing a little
      pathetic smile of welcome. Mr. Greyne clasped her hand in silence. She sat
      down in a rep chair at his right, and they looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mais, mon Dieu!</i> How monsieur is changed!&rdquo; cried the Levantine. &ldquo;If
      madame could see him! What has happened to monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Verbena,&rdquo; replied Mr. Greyne, &ldquo;I have seen the Ouled on the
      heights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A spasm crossed the Levantine&rsquo;s face. She put her handkerchief to it for a
      moment. &ldquo;What is an Ouled?&rdquo; she inquired, withdrawing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not tell you,&rdquo; he replied solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But indeed I wish to know, so that I may sympathise with monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne hesitated, but his heart was full; he felt the need of
      sympathy. He looked at Mademoiselle Verbena, and a great longing to
      unburden himself overcame him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Ouled,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;is a dancing-girl from the desert of Sahara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> How does she dance? Is it a valse, a polka, a
      quadrille?&rdquo; &ldquo;No. Would that it were!&rdquo; And Mr. Greyne, unable further to
      govern his desire for full expression, gave Mademoiselle Verbena a
      slightly Bowdlerised description of the dances of the desert. She heard
      him with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo; she exclaimed when he had finished. &ldquo;And does one pay much
      to see such steps of the Evil One?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave her twenty pounds. Abdallah Jack&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abdallah Jack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My guide informed me that was the price. He tells me it is against the
      law, and that each time an Ouled dances she risks being thrown into
      prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor lady! How sad to have to earn one&rsquo;s bread by such devices, instead
      of by teaching to the sweet little ones of monsieur the sympathetic
      grammar of one&rsquo;s native country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne was touched to the quick by this allusion, which brought, as in
      a vision, the happy home in Belgrave Square before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an angel!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Verbena shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this poor Ouled, you will go to her again?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It seems that she is in communication with all the&mdash;the&mdash;well,
      all the odd people of Algiers, and that one can only get at them through
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abdallah Jack tells me that while I am here I should pay her a weekly
      salary, and that, in return, I shall see all the terrible ceremonies of
      the Arabs. I have decided to do so&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you have decided!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Mr. Greyne started. There seemed a new sound in Mademoiselle
      Verbena&rsquo;s voice, a gleam in her dark brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, looking at her in wonder. &ldquo;But I have not yet told
      Abdallah Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Levantine looked gently sad again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said in her usual pathetic voice, &ldquo;how my heart bleeds for this
      poor Ouled. By the way, what is her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aishoush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know. She was so painted, so tattooed, so very&mdash;so very
      different from Mrs. Eustace Greyne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How sad! How terrible! Ah, but you must long for the dear bonnet strings
      of madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Did he? As she spoke Mr. Greyne asked himself the question. Shocked as he
      was, fatigued by his researches, did he wish that he were back again in
      Belgrave Square, drinking barley water, pasting notices of his wife&rsquo;s
      achievements into the new album, listening while she read aloud from the
      manuscript of her latest novel? He wondered, and&mdash;how strange, how
      almost terrible&mdash;he was not sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not so?&rdquo; murmured Mademoiselle Verbena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally I miss my beloved wife,&rdquo; said Mr. Greyne with a certain
      awkwardness. &ldquo;How is your poor, dear mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears came at once into the Levantine&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very, very ill, monsieur. Still there is a chance&mdash;just a chance
      that she may not die. Ah, when I sit here all alone in this strange place,
      I feel that she will perish, that soon I shall be quite deserted in this
      cruel, cruel world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears began to flow down her cheeks with determination. Mr. Greyne was
      terribly upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must cheer up,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You must hope for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sitting here alone, how can I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sitting here alone&mdash;very true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden thought, a number of sudden thoughts, struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not sit here alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come out. You must drive. You must see the town, distract
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how? Can a&mdash;a girl go about alone in Algiers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid! No; I will escort you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile of innocent, girlish joy transformed her face, but suddenly she
      was grave again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be right, <i>convenable?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne was reckless. The dog potential rose up in him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? And, besides, who knows us here? Not a soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put on your bonnet. Let us start at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do not wear the bonnet. I am not like madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. Your hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as she flew to obey him, Mr. Eustace Greyne found himself impiously
      thanking the powers that be for this strange chance of going on the spree
      with a toque. When Mademoiselle Verbena returned he was looking almost
      rakish. He eyed her neat black hat and close-fitting black jacket with a
      glance not wholly unlike that of a militiaman. In her hand she held a
      vivid scarlet parasol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is terrible, this <i>ombrelle</i>, when mamma
      lies at death&rsquo;s door. But what can I do? I have no other, and cannot
      afford to buy one. The sun is fierce. I dare not expose myself to it
      without a shelter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed really distressed as she opened the parasol, and spread the
      vivid silk above her pretty black-clothed figure; but Mr. Greyne thought
      the effect was brilliant, and ventured to say so. As they passed the
      bureau by the fountain on their way out the stout Frenchwoman cast an
      approving glance at Mademoiselle Verbena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little rat will not see much more of the little negro now,&rdquo; she
      murmured to herself. &ldquo;After all the English have their uses.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Belgrave Square Mrs. Eustace Greyne was beginning to get slightly
      uneasy. Several things combined to make her so. In the first place,
      Mademoiselle Verbena had never returned from her mother&rsquo;s Parisian
      bedside, and had not even written a line to say how the dear parent was,
      and when the daughter&rsquo;s nursing occupation was likely to be over. In the
      second place, Adolphus, in consequence of the Levantine&rsquo;s absence, had
      totally lost his grasp, always uncertain, upon the irregular verbs. In the
      third place, Darrell, the valet, had returned to London the day after his
      departure from it, minus not only his master&rsquo;s dressing-case, but minus
      everything he possessed. His story was that, while waiting at the station
      in Paris for his master&rsquo;s appearance, he had entered into conversation
      with an agreeable stranger, and been beguiled into the acceptance of an
      absinthe at a café just outside. After swallowing the absinthe he
      remembered nothing more till he came to himself in a deserted waiting-room
      at the Gare du Nord, back to which he had been mysteriously conveyed. In
      his pocket was no money, no watch, only the return half of a second-class
      ticket from London to Paris. He, therefore, wandered about the streets
      till morning broke, and then came back to London a crestfallen and
      miserable man, bemoaning his untoward fate, and cursing &ldquo;them blasted
      Frenchies&rdquo; from the bottom of his British heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne&rsquo;s anxiety on her husband&rsquo;s behalf, now that he was thrown
      absolutely unattended upon the inhospitable shores of Africa, was not
      lessened by a fourth circumstance, which, indeed, worried her far more
      than all the others put together. This was Mr. Greyne&rsquo;s prolonged absence
      from her side. Precisely one calendar month had now elapsed since he had
      buried his face in her prune bonnet strings at Victoria Station, and there
      seemed no prospect of his return. He wrote to her, indeed, frequently, and
      his letters were full of wistful regret and longing to be once more safe
      in the old homestead in Belgrave Square, drinking barley water, and
      pasting Romeike &amp; Curtice notices into the new album which lay, gaping
      for him, upon the table of his sanctum. But he did not come; nay, more, he
      wrote plainly that there was no prospect of his coming for the present. It
      seemed that the wickedness of Africa was very difficult to come at. It did
      not lie upon the surface, but was hidden far down in depths to which the
      ordinary tourist found it almost impossible to penetrate. In his numerous
      letters Mr. Greyne described his heroic and unremitting exertions to fill
      the Merrin&rsquo;s note-books with matter that would be suitable for the purging
      of humanity. He set out in full his interview with Alphonso at the office
      of Rook, and his definite rejection by that cosmopolitan official.
      According to the letters, after this event he had spent no less than a
      fortnight searching in vain for any sign of wickedness in the Algerian
      capital. He had frequented the cafés, the public bars, the theatres, the
      churches. He had been to the Velodrome. He had sat by the hour in the
      Jardin d&rsquo;Essai. At night he had strolled in the fairs and hung about the
      circus. Yet nowhere had he been able to perceive anything but the most
      innocent pleasure, the simple merriment of a gay and guileless population
      to whom the idea of crime seemed as foreign as the idea of singing the
      English national anthem.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the third week it was true that matters&mdash;always according to
      Mr. Greyne&rsquo;s letters home&mdash;slightly improved. While walking near the
      quay, in active search for nautical outrage, he saw an Arab dock labourer,
      who had been over-smoking kief, run amuck, and knock down a couple of
      respectable snake-charmers who were on the point of embarkation for Tunis
      with their reptiles. This incident had filed up a half-score of pages in
      exercise-book number one, and had flooded Mr. Greyne with hope and
      aspiration. But it was followed by a stagnant lull which had lasted for
      days and had only been disturbed by the trifling incident of a gentleman
      in the Jewish quarter of the town setting fire to a neighbour&rsquo;s bazaar, in
      the very natural endeavour to find a French half-penny which he had
      chanced to drop among a bale of carpets while looking in to drive a soft
      bargain. As Mrs. Greyne wired to Algiers, such incidents were of no value
      to &ldquo;Catherine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very active interchange of views had gone on between the husband and
      wife as time went by, and the book was at a standstill. At first Mrs.
      Greyne contented herself with daily letters, but latterly she had resorted
      to wires, explanatory, condemnatory, hortatory, and even comminatory. She
      began bitterly to regret her husband&rsquo;s well-proven innocence, and wished
      she had despatched an uncle of hers by marriage, an ex-captain in the
      Royal Navy, who, she began to feel certain, would have been able to find
      far more frailty in Algiers than poor Eustace, in his simplicity, would
      ever come at. She even began to wish that she had crossed the sea in
      person, and herself boldly set about the ingathering of the material for
      which she was so impatiently waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her uneasiness was brought to a head by a letter from a house agent,
      stating that the corner mansion in Park Lane next to the Duke of Ebury&rsquo;s
      was being nibbled at by a Venezuelan millionaire. She wired this terrible
      fact at once to Africa, adding, at an enormous expenditure of cash:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     This will never do. You are too innocent, and cannot see
     what lies before you. Obtain assistance. Go to the British
     consul.
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Greyne at once cabled back:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Am following your advice. Will wire result. Regret my
     innocence, but am distressed that you should so utterly
     condemn it.
</pre>
    <p>
      Upon receiving this telegram at night, before a lonely dinner, Mrs.
      Eustace Greyne was deeply moved. She felt she had been hasty. She knew
      that to very few women was it given to have a husband so free from all
      masculine infirmities as Mr. Greyne. At the same time there was
      &ldquo;Catherine,&rdquo; there was the mansion in Park Lane, there was the Venezuelan
      millionaire. She began to feel distracted, and, for the first time in her
      life, refused to partake of sweetbreads fried in mushroom ketchup, a dish
      which she had greatly affected from the time when she wrote her first
      short story. While she was in the very act of waving away this delicacy a
      footman came in with a foreign telegram. She opened it quickly, and read
      as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     British consul horrified; was ignominiously expelled from
     consulate; great scandal; am much upset, but will never give
     in, for your sake.                           Eustace.
</pre>
    <p>
      As the dread meaning of these words penetrated at length to Mrs. Greyne&rsquo;s
      voluminous brain a deep flush overspread her noble features. She rose from
      the table with a determination that struck awe to the hearts of the
      powdered underlings, and, drawing herself up to her full height,
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Mrs. Forbes at once to my study, if you please&mdash;at once, do you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment Mrs. Forbes, who was the great novelist&rsquo;s maid, appeared on
      the threshold of the oracle&rsquo;s lair. She was a sober-looking, black-silk
      personage, who always wore a pork-pie cap in the house, and a Mother
      Hubbard bonnet out of it. Having been in service with Mrs. Greyne ever
      since the latter penned her last minor poetry&mdash;Mrs. Greyne had been a
      minor poet for three years soon after she put her hair up&mdash;Mrs.
      Forbes had acquired a certain literary expression of countenance and a
      manner that was decidedly prosy. She read a good deal after her supper of
      an evening, and was wont to be the arbiter when any literary matter was
      discussed in the servants&rsquo; hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam?&rdquo; she said, respectfully entering the room, and bending the
      pork-pie cap forward in an attentive attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne was silent for a moment. She appeared to be thinking deeply.
      Mrs. Forbes gently closed the door, and sighed. It was nearly her
      supper-time, and she felt pensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam?&rdquo; she said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne looked up. A strange fire burned in her large eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Forbes,&rdquo; she said at length, with weighty deliberation, &ldquo;the mission
      of woman in the world is a great one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, madam. My own words to Butler Phillips no longer ago than
      dinner this midday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the protecting of man&mdash;neither more nor less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own statement, madam, to Second Footman Archibald this self-same day
      at the tea-board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man needs guidance, and looks for it to us&mdash;or rather to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the last word Mrs. Forbes pinched her lips together, and appeared older
      than her years and sourer than her normal temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this moment, Mrs. Forbes,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Greyne, with rising fervour,
      &ldquo;he looks for it to me from Africa. From that dark continent he stretches
      forth his hands to me in humble supplication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Greyne has not been taken with another of his bilious attacks, I
      hope, madam?&rdquo; said Mrs. Forbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne smiled. The ignorance of the humbly born entertained her. It
      was so simple, so transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fail to understand me,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But never mind; others have
      done the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought of her reviewers. Mrs. Forbes smiled. She also could be
      entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam?&rdquo; she inquired once more after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall leave for Africa to-morrow morning,&rdquo; said Mrs. Greyne. &ldquo;You will
      accompany me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will accompany me. Do you understand? Obtain assistance from the
      housemaids in the packing. Select my quietest gowns, my least conspicuous
      bonnets. I have my reasons for wishing, while journeying to Africa and
      remaining there, to pass, if possible, unnoticed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a pause. Mrs. Greyne looked up at Mrs. Forbes, and
      observed a dogged expression upon her countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she asked the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do we go by Paris, madam?&rdquo; said Mrs. Forbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, madam, I&rsquo;m very sorry, but I couldn&rsquo;t risk it, not if it was ever
      so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Why this fear of Lutetia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, I&rsquo;m not afraid of any Lutetia as ever wore apron, but to go to
      Paris to be drugged with absint, and put away in a third-class
      waiting-room like a package&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t madam, not even if I have to
      leave your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne recognised that the episode of the valet had struck home to
      the lady&rsquo;s maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will not leave my side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will absint you, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will travel first in a sleeping-car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes put up her hand to her pork-pie cap, as if considering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, madam, to oblige you I will undergo it,&rdquo; she said at length.
      &ldquo;But I would not do the like for another living lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will raise your wages. You are a faithful creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does master expect us, madam?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Forbes as she prepared to
      retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bright and tender look stole into Mrs. Greyne&rsquo;s intellectual face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her large and beaming eyes full upon the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Forbes,&rdquo; she said, with an amount of emotion that was very rare in
      her, &ldquo;I am going to tell you a great truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam?&rdquo; said Mrs. Forbes respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sweetest moments of life, those which lift man nearest heaven, and
      make him thankful for the great gift of existence, are sometimes those
      which are unforeseen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was thinking of Mr. Greyne&rsquo;s ecstasy when, upon the inhospitable
      African shore where he was now enduring such tragic misfortunes, he
      perceived the majestic form of his loved one&mdash;his loved one whom he
      believed to be in Belgrave Square&mdash;coming towards him to soothe, to
      comfort, to direct. She brushed away a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, Mrs. Forbes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Forbes retired, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      An epic might well be written on the great novelist&rsquo;s journey to Africa,
      upon her departure from Charing Cross, shrouded in a black gauze veil, her
      silent thought as the good ship <i>Empress</i> rode cork-like upon the
      Channel waves, her ascetic lunch&mdash;a captain&rsquo;s biscuit and a glass of
      water&mdash;at the buffet at Calais, her arrival in Paris when the shades
      of night had fallen. An epic might well be written. Perhaps some day it
      will be, by herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Paris she suffered a good deal on account of Mrs. Forbes, who, in her
      fear of &ldquo;ab-sint,&rdquo; became hysterical, and caused not a little annoyance by
      accusing various inoffensive French travellers of nefarious designs upon
      her property and person. In the Gulf of Lyons she suffered even more, and
      as, unluckily, the wind was contrary and the sea prodigious during the
      whole of the passage across the Mediterranean, both she and Mrs. Forbes
      arrived at Algiers four hours late, in a condition which may be more
      easily imagined than properly described.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genius in thrall to the body, and absolutely dependent upon green
      chartreuse for its flickering existence, is no subject for even a
      sympathetic pen. Sufficient to say that, when the ship came in under the
      lights of Algiers, the crowd of shouting Arabs was struck to silence by
      the spectacle of Mrs. Greyne and Mrs. Forbes endeavouring to disembark, in
      bonnets that were placed seaward upon the head instead of landward,
      unbuttoned boots, and gowns soaked with the attentions of the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      After being gently and permanently relieved of their light hand-baggage,
      the mistress and maid, who seemed greatly overwhelmed by the sight of
      Africa, and who moved&mdash;or rather were carried&mdash;as in a dream,
      were placed reverently in the nearest omnibus, and conveyed to the
      farthest hotel, which was situated upon a lofty hill above the town. Here
      a slightly painful scene took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having been assisted by the staff into a Moorish hall, Mrs. Greyne
      inquired in a reticent voice for her husband, and was politely informed
      that there was no person of the name of Greyne in the hotel. For a moment
      she seemed threatened with dissolution, but with a supreme effort calling
      upon her mighty brain she surmised that her husband was possibly passing
      under a pseudonym in order to throw America off the scent. She, therefore,
      demanded to have the guests then present in the hotel at once paraded
      before her. As there was some difficulty about this&mdash;the guests being
      then at dinner&mdash;she whispered for the visitors&rsquo; book, thinking that,
      perchance, Mr. Greyne had inscribed his name there, and that the staff,
      being foreign, did not recognise it as murmured by herself. The book was
      brought, upon its cover in golden letters the words: &ldquo;Hôtel Loubet et
      Majestic.&rdquo; Then explanations of a somewhat disagreeable nature occurred,
      and Mrs. Greyne and Mrs. Forbes, after a heavy payment had been exacted
      for their conveyance to a place they had desired not to go to, were
      carried forth, and consigned to another vehicle, which at length brought
      them, on the stroke of nine, to the Grand Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having been placed reverently in the brilliantly-lighted hall, they were
      surrounded by the proprietor, the <i>maître d&rsquo;hôtel</i> and his
      assistants, the porters, and the chasseurs, with all of whom Mr. Greyne
      was now familiar. Brandy and water having been supplied, together with
      smelling-salts and burnt feathers, Mrs. Greyne roused herself from an
      acute attack of lethargy, and asked for Mr. Greyne. A joyous smile ran
      round the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Greyne,&rdquo; said the proprietor, &ldquo;who is living here for the
      winter?&rdquo; 4
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Eustace Greyne,&rdquo; murmured the great novelist, grasping her bonnet
      with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>maître d&rsquo;hôtel</i> drew nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame wishes to see Monsieur Greyne?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do&mdash;at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A blessed consciousness of Mother Earth was gradually beginning to steal
      over her. She even strove feebly to sit up on her chair, a German-Swiss
      porter of enormous size assisting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Monsieur Greyne is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame. Monsieur Greyne is always out at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the little chasseur who knew no better began to twinkle. Mrs.
      Forbes gave a slight cough. Tears filled the novelist&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my Eustace!&rdquo; she murmured, deeply touched by this evidence of
      his devotion to her interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; asked the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does Mr. Greyne go?&rdquo; inquired the novelist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Kasbah, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Greyne, with returning animation. &ldquo;I knew it would
      be so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame is acquainted with Monsieur Greyne?&rdquo; said the <i>maître d&rsquo;hôtel</i>,
      while the little crowd gathered more closely about the wave-worn group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mrs. Eustace Greyne,&rdquo; returned the great novelist recklessly. &ldquo;I am
      the wife of Mr. Eustace Greyne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of supreme silence. Then a loud, an even piercing &ldquo;<i>Oh,
      là, là,</i> broke upon the air, succeeded instantaneously by a burst of
      laughter that seemed to thrill with all the wild blessedness of boyhood.
      It came, of course, from the little chasseur; it came, and stayed. Nothing
      could stop it, and eventually the happy child had to be carried forth upon
      the sea-front to enjoy his innocent mirth at leisure and in solitude
      beneath the African stars. Mrs. Greyne did not notice his disappearance.
      She was intent upon important matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what time does Mr. Greyne usually set forth?&rdquo; she asked of the
      proprietor, whose face now bore a strangely twisted appearance, as if
      afflicted by a toothache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately after dinner, madame, if not before. Of late it has generally
      been before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he stays out late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very late, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The twisted appearance began to seem infectious. It was visible upon the
      faces of most of those surrounding Mrs. Greyne and Mrs. Forbes. Indeed,
      even the latter showed some signs of it, although the large shadow cast
      over her features by the hind side of her Mother Hubbard bonnet to some
      extent disguised them from the public view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till what hour?&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Greyne in a voice of almost yearning
      tenderness and pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame&rdquo;&mdash;the proprietor displayed some slight confusion&mdash;&ldquo;I
      really can hardly say. The <i>maître d&rsquo;hôtel</i> can perhaps inform you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne turned her ox-like eyes upon the enlarged edition of Napoleon
      the First.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Greyne seldom returns before seven or eight o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning, madame. He then retires to bed, and comes down to breakfast at
      about four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne was touched to the very quick. Her husband was sacrificing his
      rest, his health&mdash;nay, perhaps even his very life&mdash;in her
      service. It was well she had come, well that a period was to be put to
      these terrible researches. They should be stopped at once, even this very
      night. Better a thousand literary failures than that her husband&rsquo;s
      existence should be placed in jeopardy. She rose suddenly from her chair,
      tottered, gasped, recovered herself, and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prepare dinner for me at once,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and order a carriage and a
      competent guide to be before the door in half-an-hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame is going out? But madame is ill, tired!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It matters not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does madame wish to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to the Kasbah to find my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will escort madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor, the <i>maître d&rsquo;hôtel</i>, the waiters, the porters, the
      chasseurs, Mrs. Greyne and Mrs. Forbes, all turned about to face the
      determined speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there before them, his dark eyes gleaming, his long moustaches
      bristling fiercely&mdash;here stood Abdallah Jack.

      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Man is a self-deceiver. It must, therefore, ever be a doubtful point
      whether Mr. Eustace Greyne, during his residence in Africa, absolutely
      lost sight of his sense of duty; whether, beguiled by the lively
      attentions of a fiercely foreign town, he deliberately resolved to take
      his pleasure regardless of consequences and of the sacred ties of Belgrave
      Square. We prefer to think that some vague idea of combining two duties&mdash;that
      which he owed to himself and that which he owed to Mrs. Greyne&mdash;moved
      him in all he did, and that the subterfuge into which he was undoubtedly
      led was not wholly selfish, not wholly criminal. Nevertheless, that he had
      lied to his beloved wife is certain. Even while she sat over a cutlet and
      a glass of claret in the white-and-gold dining-room of the Grand Hotel,
      preparatory to her departure to the Kasbah with Abdallah Jack, the dozen
      of Merrin&rsquo;s exercise-books lay upstairs in Mr. Greyne&rsquo;s apartments filled
      to the brim with African frailty. Already there was material enough in
      their pages to furnish forth a library of &ldquo;Catherines.&rdquo; Yet Mr. Greyne
      still lingered far from his home, and wired to that home fabricated
      accounts of the singular innocence of Algiers. He even allowed it to be
      supposed that his own innocence stood in the way of his fulfilment of Mrs.
      Greyne&rsquo;s behests&mdash;he who could now have given points in knowledge of
      the world to whole regiments of militiamen!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not right, and, doubtless, he must stand condemned by every
      moralist. But let it not be forgotten that he had fallen under the
      influence of a Levantine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Verbena&rsquo;s mother, hidden in some unnamed hospital of Algiers,
      appeared to be one of those ingenious elderly ladies who can hover
      indefinitely upon the brink of death without actually dying. During the
      whole time that Mr. Greyne had been in Africa her state had been
      desperate, yet she still clung to life. As her daughter said, she
      possessed extraordinary vitality, and this vitality seemed to have been
      inherited by her child. Despite her grave anxieties Mademoiselle Verbena
      succeeded in sustaining a remarkable cheeriness, and even a fascinating
      vivacity, when in the company of others. As she said to Mr. Greyne, she
      did not think it right to lay her burdens upon the shoulders of her
      neighbours. She, therefore, forced herself to appear contented, even at
      various moments gay, when she and Mr. Greyne were lunching, dining, or
      supping together, were driving upon the front, sailing upon the azure
      waters of the bay, riding upon the heights beyond El-Biar, or, ensconced
      in a sumptuous private box, listening to the latest French farce at one or
      another of the theatres. Only one day, when they had driven out to the
      monastery at La Trappe de Staouëli, did a momentary cloud descend upon her
      piquant features, and she explained this by the frank confession that she
      had always wished to become a nun, but had been hindered from following
      her vocation by the necessity of earning money to support her aged
      parents. Mr. Greyne had never seen the Ouled since his first evening in
      Algiers, but he still paid her a weekly salary, through Abdallah Jack, who
      explained to him that the interesting lady, in a discreet retirement, was
      perpetually occupied in arranging the exhibitions of African frailty at
      which he so frequently assisted. She was, in fact, earning her liberal
      salary. Mademoiselle Verbena and Abdallah Jack had met on several
      occasions, and Mr. Greyne had introduced the latter to the former as his
      guide, and had generously praised his abilities; but in Mademoiselle
      Verbena took very little notice of him, and, as time went on, Abdallah
      Jack seemed to conceive a most distressing dislike of her. On several
      occasions he advised Mr. Greyne not to frequent her company so
      assiduously, and when Mr. Greyne asked him to explain the meaning of his
      monitions he took refuge in vague generalities and Eastern imagery. He had
      a profound contempt for women as companions, which grieved Mr. Greyne&rsquo;s
      Western ideas, and evidently thought that Mademoiselle Verbena ought to be
      clapped forthwith into a long veil, and put away in a harem behind an iron
      grille. When Mr. Greyne explained the English point of view Abdallah Jack
      took refuge in a sulky silence; but during the week immediately preceding
      the arrival of Mrs. Greyne his temper had become actively bad, and Mr.
      Greyne began seriously to consider whether it would not be better to pay
      him a last <i>douceur</i>, and tell him to go about his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before doing this, however, Mr. Greyne desired to have one more interview
      with the mysterious Ouled on the heights, to whom he owed the knowledge
      which would henceforth enable him to cut out the militia. He said so to
      Abdallah Jack. The latter agreed sulkily to arrange it; and matters so
      fell out that on the night of Mrs. Greyne&rsquo;s arrival her husband was seated
      in a room in one of the remotest houses of the Kasbah, watching the
      Ouled&rsquo;s mysterious evolutions, while Mademoiselle Verbena&mdash;as she
      herself had informed Mr.4 Greyne&mdash;sat in the hospital by the bedside
      of her still dying mother. Abdallah Jack had apparently been most anxious
      to assist at Mr. Greyne&rsquo;s interview with the Ouled, but Mr. Greyne had
      declined to allow this. The evil temper of the guide was beginning to get
      thoroughly upon his employer&rsquo;s nerves, and even the natural desire to have
      an interpreter at hand was overborne by the dislike of Abdallah Jack&rsquo;s
      morose eyes and sarcastic speeches about women. Moreover, the Ouled spoke
      a word or two of uncertain French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, therefore, things fell out, and such was the precise situation when
      Mrs. Greyne flicked a crumb from her chocolate brocade gown, tied her
      bonnet strings, and rose from table to set forth to the Kasbah with
      Abdallah Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a radiant night. In the clear sky the stars shone brilliantly,
      looking down upon the persistent convulsions of the little chasseur, who
      had not yet recovered from his attack of merriment on learning who Mrs.
      Greyne was. The sea, quite calm now that the great novelist was no longer
      upon it, lapped softly along the curving shores of the bay. The palm-trees
      of the town garden where the band plays on warm evenings waved lazily in
      the soft and scented breeze. The hooded figures of the Arabs lounged
      against the stone wall that girdles the sea-front. In the
      brilliantly-illuminated restaurants the rich French population gathered
      about the little tables, while the withered beggars stared in upon the
      oyster shells, the champagne bottles, and the feathers in the women&rsquo;s
      audacious hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Greyne emerged upon the pavement before the Grand Hotel,
      attended by Mrs. Forbes and the guide, she paused for a moment, and cast a
      searching glance upon the fairy scene. In this voluptuous evening and
      strange environment life seemed oddly dreamlike. She scarcely felt like
      Mrs. Greyne. Possibly Mrs. Forbes also felt unlike herself, for she
      suddenly placed one hand upon her left side, and tottered. Abdallah Jack
      supported her. She screamed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is the vertigo. I am overtook!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was really ill; her face, indeed, became the colour of a plover&rsquo;s egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go to bed, madam,&rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;It is the vertigo, madam. I am
      overtook!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under ordinary circumstances Mrs. Greyne would have prescribed a dose of
      Kasbah air, but to-night she felt strange, and she wanted strangeness.
      Mrs. Forbes with the vertigo, in a small carriage, would be inappropriate.
      She, therefore, bade her retire, mounted into the vehicle with Abdallah
      Jack, and was quickly driven away, her bonnet strings floating upon the
      winsome wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know my husband?&rdquo; she asked softly of the guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abdallah Jack replied in French that he rather thought he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he looking?&rdquo; continued Mrs. Greyne in a slightly yearning voice.
      &ldquo;My Eustace!&rdquo; she added to herself, &ldquo;my devoted one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Greyne is pale as washed linen upon the Kasbah wall,&rdquo; replied
      Abdallah Jack, lighting a cigarette, and wreathing the great novelist in
      its grey-blue smoke. &ldquo;He is thin as the Spahi&rsquo;s lance, he is nervous as
      the leaves of the eucalyptus-tree when the winds blow from the north.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne was seriously perturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would I had come before!&rdquo; she murmured, with serious self-reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Greyne is worse than all the English,&rdquo; pursued Abdallah Jack in
      a voice that sounded to Mrs. Greyne decidedly sinister. &ldquo;He is worse than
      the tourists of Rook, who laugh in the doorways of the mosques and twine
      in their hair the dried lizards of the Sahara. Even the guide of Rook
      rejected him. I only would undertake him because I am full of evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne began to feel distinctly uncomfortable, and to wish she had
      not been so ready to pander to Mrs. Forbes&rsquo; vertigo. She stole a sidelong
      glance at her strange companion. The carriage was small. The end of his
      bristling black moustache was very near. What he said of Mr. Greyne did
      not disturb her, because she knew that her Eustace had sacrificed his
      reputation to do her service; but what he said about himself was not
      reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you must be doing yourself an injustice,&rdquo; she said in a rather
      agitated voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe you are so bad as you imply,&rdquo; she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage turned with a jerk out of the brilliantly-lighted
      thoroughfare that runs along the sea into a narrow side street, crowded
      with native Jews, and dark with shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame does not know me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exact truth of this observation struck home, like a dagger, to the
      mind of Mrs. Greyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a wicked person,&rdquo; added Abdallah Jack, with a profound conviction.
      &ldquo;That is why Monsieur Greyne chose me as his guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The novelist began to quake. Her chocolate brocade fluttered. Was she
      herself to learn at first hand, and on her first evening in Africa, enough
      about African frailty to last her for the rest of her life? And how much
      more of life would remain to her after her stock of knowledge had been
      thus increased? The carriage turned into a second side street, narrower
      and darker than the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we going right?&rdquo; she said apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madame; we are going wrong&mdash;we are going to the wicked part of
      the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;you are sure Mr. Greyne will be there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abdallah Jack laughed sardonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Greyne is never anywhere else. Monsieur Greyne is wicked as is a
      mad Touareg of the desert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you quite understand my husband,&rdquo; said Mrs. Greyne, feeling
      in duty bound to stand up for her poor, maligned Eustace. &ldquo;Whatever he may
      have done he has done at my special request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame says?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say that in all his proceedings while in Algiers Mr. Greyne has been
      acting under my directions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abdallah Jack fixed his enormous eyes steadily upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are his wife, and told him to come here, and to do as he has done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-yes,&rdquo; faltered Mrs. Greyne, for the first time in her life feeling as
      if she were being escorted towards the criminal dock by a jailer with
      Puritan tendencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is true what they say on the shores of the great canal,&rdquo; he
      remarked composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Greyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That England is a land of female devils,&rdquo; returned the guide as the
      carriage plunged into a filthy alley, between two rows of blind houses,
      and began to ascend a steep hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne gasped. She opened her lips to protest vigorously, but her
      head swam&mdash;either from indignation or from fatigue&mdash;and she
      could not utter a word. The horses mounted like cats upward into the dense
      blackness, from which dropped down the faint sounds of squealing music and
      of hoarse cries and laughter. The wheels bounded over the stones, sank
      into the deep ruts, scraped against the sides of the unlighted houses. And
      Abdallah Jack sat staring at Mrs. Greyne as an English clergyman&rsquo;s wife
      might stare at the appalling rites of some deadly cannibal encountered in
      a far-off land, with a stony wonder, a sort of paralysed curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the carriage stopped on a piece of waste land covered with small
      pebbles. Abdallah Jack sprang out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do we stop?&rdquo; said Mrs. Greyne, turning as pale as ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage can go no farther. Madame must walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne began to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are to leave the coachman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall escort madame, alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great novelist&rsquo;s tongue cleaved to the roof of her mouth. She felt
      like a Merrin&rsquo;s exercise-book, every leaf of which was covered with
      African frailty. However, there was no help for it. She had to descend,
      and stand among the pebbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abdallah Jack waved his hand towards a stone rampart dimly seen in the
      faint light that emanated from the starry sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down there into the alley of the Dead Dervishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne could not repress a cry of horror. At that moment she would
      have given a thousand pounds to have Mrs. Forbes at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abdallah Jack grasped her by the hand, and led her ruthlessly forward.
      Gazing with terror-stricken eyes over the crumbling rampart of the Kasbah,
      she saw the city far below her, the lights of the streets, the lights of
      the ships in harbour. She heard the music of a bugle, and wished she were
      a Zouave safe in barracks. She wished she were a German-Swiss porter, a
      merry chasseur&mdash;anything but Mrs. Eustace Greyne. One thing alone
      supported her in this hour of trial, the thought of her husband&rsquo;s ecstasy
      when she appeared upon the dread scene of his awful labours, to tell him
      that he was released, that he need visit them no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alley of the Dead Dervishes is long and winding. To Mrs. Greyne it
      seemed endless. As she threaded it with faltering step, gripped by the
      feverish hand of Abdallah Jack, who now began to display a strange and
      terrible excitement, she became a centre of curiosity. Unwashed Arabs,
      rakish Zouaves in blue and red, wandering Jews of various nationalities,
      unveiled dancing-girls covered with jewels, stared in wonder upon the
      chocolate brocade and the floating bonnet strings, followed upon her
      footsteps, pointing with painted fingers, and making remarks of a personal
      nature in French, Arabic, and other unknown tongues. She moved in the
      midst of a crowd, on and on before lighted interiors from which wild music
      flowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we never be there?&rdquo; she panted to Abdallah Jack. &ldquo;My limbs refuse
      their office.&rdquo; She jogged against a Tunisian Jewess in a pointed hat, and
      rebounded upon an enormous Riff in a tattered sheep-skin. &ldquo;I can go no
      farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are there! Behold the house of the Ouled!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he uttered the last word he burst into a bitter laugh, and drew Mrs.
      Greyne, now gasping for breath, through an open doorway into a little hall
      of imitation marble, with fluted pillars adorned with oilcloth, and walls
      hung with imported oleographs. From a chamber on the right, near a winding
      staircase covered with blue-and-white tiles, came the sound of laughter,
      of song, and of a hideous music conveyed to the astonied ear by pipes and
      drums.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are in there!&rdquo; exclaimed Abdallah Jack, folding his arms, and
      looking at Mrs. Greyne. &ldquo;Go to your husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greyne put her hands to her magnificent forehead, and tottered
      forward. She reached the door, she pushed it, she entered. There upon a
      wooden dais, surrounded by gilt mirrors and artificial roses, she beheld
      her husband, in a check suit and a white Homburg hat, performing the
      wildest evolutions, while opposite him a lady, smothered in coloured silks
      and coins, tattooed and painted, dyed and scented, covered with kohl and
      crowned with ostrich feathers, screamed a nasal chant of the East, and
      bounded like an electrified monkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eustace!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Greyne, leaning for support against an oleograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eustace!&rdquo; she cried again. &ldquo;It is I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood as if turned to stone. Mrs. Greyne hesitated, started, moved
      forward to the dais, and stared upon the Ouled, who had also ceased from
      dancing, and looked strangely surprised, even confused, by the great
      novelist&rsquo;s intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Verbena!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Miss Verbena in Algiers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eugenia!&rdquo; said Mr. Greyne in a husky voice, &ldquo;what is this you say? This
      lady is the Ouled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sardonic laugh came from the doorway. They turned. There stood Abdallah
      Jack. He advanced roughly to the Ouled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said angrily. &ldquo;Have we not earned the money of the stranger?
      Have we not earned enough? To-morrow you shall marry me as you have
      promised, and we will return to our own land, to the canal where you and I
      were born. And nevermore shall the Levantine instruct the babes of the
      English devils, but dwell veiled and guarded in the harem of her master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Verbena!&rdquo; said Mr. Greyne in a more husky voice. &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;your
      dying mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sleeps, monsieur, in the white sands of Ismailia, beside the bitter
      lake. I trust that madame can now go on with the respectable &lsquo;Catherine.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with an ironic reverence to Mrs. Eustace Greyne she placed her hand in
      Abdallah Jack&rsquo;s and vanished from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catherine&rsquo;s Repentance,&rdquo; published in a gigantic volume not many weeks
      ago, was preceded by Mr. Eustace Greyne&rsquo;s. When last heard of he was
      seated in the magnificent library of the corner house in Park Lane next to
      the Duke of Ebury&rsquo;s, busily engaged in pasting the newspaper notices of
      Mrs. Greyne&rsquo;s greatest work into a superb new album.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abdallah Jacks have returned to the Suez Canal, bearing with them a
      snug little fortune to be invested in the purchase of a coal wharf at Port
      Said, and a remarkably handsome crocodile dressing-case, fitted with gold,
      and monogrammed with the initials &ldquo;E. G.&rdquo;
